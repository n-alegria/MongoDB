# MongoDB
> MongoDB is a document database and can be installed locally or hosted in the cloud.

- A document is the basic unit of data for MongoDB and is roughly equivalent to a row in a relational database management system (but much more expressive).
- Similarly, a collection can be thought of as a table with a dynamic schema.
- A single instance of MongoDB can host multiple independent databases, each of which can have its own collections.
- Every document has a special key, "_id", that is unique within a collection.
- MongoDB comes with a simple but powerful JavaScript shell, which is useful for the administration of MongoDB instances and data manipulation.
